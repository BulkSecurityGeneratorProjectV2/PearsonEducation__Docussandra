### Docussandra: A REST-based, Document-Oriented Database with Cassandra as a Backend
---
**Docussandra** marries MongoDB's simple data storage model with the horizontal scaling of Cassandra. It enables developers to store arbitrary payloads as
BSON, as they would with MongoDB, in a Cassandra cluster. It supports indexing, filtering, sorting, querying and pagination
(via familiar limit and offset semantics), all at a blazing speed. Simple json document storage with effortless scaling exposed as a service - **that's Docussandra**!
